<!--l. 4--><p class="indent" >   Michael is teaching an algorithms class. In the last lecture he gave his students the following
problem:
<div class="center" 
>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >
<div class="fbox"> <div class="minipage">Given are several cubes of various sizes. You can make towers out of the cubes by placing
them one atop another, in any order. Your task is to find the <span 
class="cmti-10">largest possible </span>height <span 
class="cmmi-10">H</span>
such that is is possible to build <span 
class="cmti-10">two separate towers </span>of height <span 
class="cmmi-10">H</span>.
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >For example, if the cube sizes are (8,6,3,3,3,2), then the solution is 11: <br 
class="newline" />we can build one tower as 8+3, the other as 6+3+2, and a cube of size 3 remains unused.</div></div>
</div>
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   This task proved to be too difficult for his students, so each of them just implemented some clever hack that
sometimes worked and sometimes failed. More precisely:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Alla implemented a brute force solution. She sorts the cubes in descending order. If there are more
     than 10, she just takes the 10 largest cubes. Then she tries all possible ways how to build two towers
     and finds the best one in which the towers are of equal height.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Bob finds and outputs the best solution that only leaves at most two cubes unused.
     <!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >To do so, he used dynamic programming to implement a function that takes a set of cubes and
     checks whether it is possible to build two equal towers using <span 
class="cmti-10">all of them</span>. He then calls this function
     multiple times, each time with a different subset of the given set of cubes.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Chermi loves greedy algorithms. His program finds the largest <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>for which his greedy algorithm
     manages to build two towers of height <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>each.
     <!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >His algorithm to build two towers of height <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>is simple: He first sorts the cubes in descending
     order, and then processes them one by one. Each time he checks whether he can add the cube to
     the currently smaller tower without exceeding <span 
class="cmmi-10">X</span>, and if he can, he does so.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Dominika&#8217;s solution is perhaps the most clever one. She used dynamic programming. For each <span 
class="cmmi-10">H</span>
     she computed the number of ways in which a tower of size <span 
class="cmmi-10">H </span>can be assembled. The answer she
     outputs is the largest <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>such that the tower of height 2<span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>can be assembled, and the tower of height
     <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>can be assembled in at least two different ways.</li></ul>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Problem specification</span>
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   You are given the four programs made by Michael&#8217;s students (for your convenience, each of them is
implemented in several languages). Your goal is to help Michael show the students their errors by providing
inputs for which the students&#8217; solutions fail.
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   The input file contains implementations of the four students&#8217; programs in C++, Pascal, and
Python.
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Output specification</span>
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   As the output for the <span 
class="cmbx-10">easy </span>data set F1, output 4 lines, containing 2 valid test cases. Each test case
consists of two lines. The first line contains the number <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>of cubes (1 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&le; </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span><span 
class="cmsy-10">&le; </span>100). The second line
contains <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>space-separated integers &#8211; the cube sizes. The sum of all cube sizes must not exceed
10<span style="margin-left:0.3em" class="thinspace"></span>000.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   The submission will be judged as correct if it breaks at least three of our solutions. In other words, at most
one of our four solutions can give the correct answer for both your test cases.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   As the output for the <span 
class="cmbx-10">hard </span>data set F2, output 2 lines containing a single valid test case.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   The submission will be judged as correct if it breaks all four solutions. That is, none of the four solutions
should give the correct answer for your test case.
