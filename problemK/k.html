<!--l. 4--><p class="indent" >   Tired of being seen as the endless supply of brute force for the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon
High Council has decided to start a training program aimed on spaceship battle tactics. The main part of the
program is a game that is played by two of the trainees.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The game is played using a fleet of <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>spaceships. The space is divided into a cube grid of sectors. Each sector
is uniquely identified by its three integer coordinates. Each sector may contain multiple spaceships. During the
game the spaceships are traveling between sectors in order to reach a target planet that is located in the sector
(0<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>0<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>0). When all the ships reach this sector, the game is over and the player who finished the maneuver is
decorated as the winner.
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   Each turn of the game looks as follows: The player whose turn it is must first <span 
class="cmbx-10">contact </span>between 1 and <span 
class="cmmi-10">K</span>
ships, and then <span 
class="cmbx-10">order </span>each of the contacted ships to move. The turn ends when all ships finish executing their
orders.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Different ships may receive different orders. Each ship must be ordered to move into a sector that is strictly
closer to the target planet than its current sector. (When measuring the distance between sectors, we measure
the Euclidean distance of their centers.)
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Problem specification</span>
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Given are the number of ships <span 
class="cmmi-10">N</span>, the limit on moves per turn <span 
class="cmmi-10">K </span>and the initial sectors of all ships. Compute
which of the two players will win the game if both players play optimally.
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Input specification</span>
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   The first line of the input file contains an integer <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>specifying the number of test cases. Each test case is
preceded by a blank line.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   Each test case starts with a line containing the number of ships <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>and the limit <span 
class="cmmi-10">K</span>. The <span 
class="cmmi-10">i</span>-th of the next <span 
class="cmmi-10">N</span>
lines contains three integers: the coordinates of the sector where the <span 
class="cmmi-10">i</span>-th ship starts.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   In the easy input you may assume that the coordinates are small and that in each test case either <span 
class="cmmi-10">K </span>= 1 or
<span 
class="cmmi-10">K </span>= <span 
class="cmmi-10">N</span>.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Output specification</span>
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   For each test case output a single line with the string <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Player</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x00A0;1</span></span></span> if the first player has a winning strategy and
the string <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Player</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x00A0;2</span></span></span> otherwise.
