class="cmbx-10">Note. </span>This is a special problem. No points can be gained for this problem. <br 
class="newline" />The only thing you can gain is negative penalty time.                                              </div> </div>

<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   In Asimov&#8217;s famous series of books on the Foundation one of the main characters, Hari Seldon, is credited
with inventing psychohistory: a scientific discipline that can use statistics to predict the behavior of large groups
of people. We are now asking you to lay the foundations of psychohistory for real. Your goal is to predict the
behavior of your fellow contestants as good as you can.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   We will be playing a simple game. In the game you have a single submit. You can use this submit at
any point during the game. If you do so, we will record the exact <span 
class="cmbx-10">time </span>between the start of the
game and the moment of your submission. During the game these submits are <span 
class="cmbx-10">not shown </span>in the
standings.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   Once the game is over, we will then compute the <span 
class="cmbx-10">average </span>of all the submission times. Your goal in this
game: your time must be as close as possible to <span 
class="cmbx-10">two thirds of that average</span>.
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Example</span>
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Three teams take part in the game. The first team submits 500 seconds after the game starts, the second
team submits at 600 seconds and the third one at 1690 seconds.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   The average submission time is (500 + 600 + 1690)<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>3 = 2790<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>3 = 930 seconds. Two thirds of that average is
930 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&sdot; </span>(2<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>3) = 620. The second team&#8217;s submission time is closest to 620.
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Input specification</span>
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   You may submit anything you wish to (e.g., an empty file). The content of your submission does not matter,
only the time is important.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmbx-10">first game </span>starts at the beginning of the contest and ends after two hours. During these two hours you
may submit the <span 
class="cmbx-10">easy data set </span>M1 in order to play this game.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   After two hours the first round will be evaluated and the results <span 
class="cmbx-10">will be made public</span>.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmbx-10">second game </span>starts at 2h30 and ends at 4h30 into the contest. (I.e., it starts in the middle of the
contest and ends 30 minutes before its end.) During these two hours you may submit the <span 
class="cmbx-10">hard data set </span>M2 in
order to play this game. (Note that the time you choose is the time since the beginning of the <span 
class="cmbx-10">game</span>, not the
beginning of the <span 
class="cmbx-10">contest</span>.)
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   After the second game ends, it will be evaluated and the results will be made public.
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmssbx-10">Evaluation</span>
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   In the first game the following scoring is used. For each team only the best option applies.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Any team within 5 seconds of the goal gains -120 penalty minutes.

     <li class="itemize">Any team within five minutes of the goal gains -20 penalty minutes.</li></ul>
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   In the second game the scoring will be double (i.e., -240 for an exact guess, etc.).
